# Pipelined Processor Design <br>
### (Mar’23-May’23) <br>
Course Project | Advisor: Prof. Virendra Singh, CADS Lab | IIT Bombay<br>
• Designed a functional 6-stage RISC Processor with Pipelined Architecture for greater cycle frequencies<br>
• Implemented advanced features like multi-level data forwarding and a history bit-based branch predictor,
to minimize possible data hazards and improve branch prediction accuracy, for operation without stalls<br>
• Utilized Behavioural Modelling in VHDL for implementation, thoroughly testing it using ModelSim.<br>
• Implemented and Tested the Processor on a Xen10 FPGA board with programs in the RISC-ISA<br>
